                        NIT Goa is one of the Premier Institutes of National Importance in India,
                        currently operating at a transit campus at Ponda, while waiting for our
                        Permanent Campus at Cuncolim to be ready. It is no small feat that we have
                        secured a NIRF rank of 88 in a transit campus, this shows the true potential
                        of NIT Goa for growth and expansion. NIT Goa has organised various events
                        and activities for its students and is now bringing SAAVYAS 2023 after a
                        break of 3 years. <br /> <br /> SAAVYAS is NIT Goa's very own
                        Techno-Cultural Fest, it comprises of a beautiful balance of various events
                        catering to the very diverse audience of Goa. Students from all over Goa and
                        beyond come together to participate in the event. This year we wish to host
                        the event on a much higher scale and make the fest a grand spectacle and a
                        memorable event.
