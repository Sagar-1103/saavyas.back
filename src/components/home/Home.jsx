                        SAAVYAS is NIT Goa's very own Techno - Cultural Fest, it comprises of a
                        beautiful balance of various events catering to the very diverse audience of
                        Goa. Students from all over Goa and beyond come together to participate in
                        the event. This year we wish to host the event on a much higher scale and
                        make the fest a grand spectacle and a memorable event.
