                    NIT Goa is one of the Premier Institutes of National Importance in India,
                    currently operating at a transit campus at Ponda, while waiting for our
                    Permanent Campus at Cuncolim to be ready. <br /> <br />
                    It is no small feat that we have secured a NIRF rank of 88 in a transit campus,
                    this shows the true potential of NIT Goa for growth and expansion. NIT Goa has
                    organised various events and activities for its students and is now bringing
                    SAAVYAS 2023 after a break of 3 years. <br /> <br /> SAAVYAS is NIT Goa's very
                    own Techno-Cultural Fest, it comprises of a beautiful balance of various events
                    catering to the very diverse audience of Goa. Students from all over Goa and
                    beyond come together to participate in the event. <br /> <br />
                    This year we wish to host the event on a much higher scale and make the fest a
                    grand spectacle and a memorable event.

                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable
                    content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is
                    that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using
                    'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
                    publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default
                    model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in
                    their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by
                    accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
